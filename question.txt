Power Motor Industries Sdn Bhd has been acquired by Tesla Motor Inc. Due to acquisition, current practice for
calculating hourly employees needs to streamline with Tesla Motor accounting practice. These new rules affect
the calculation of overtime for hourly employees.
These new rules require a different rate for each employee based on the year of service and number of
overtime hours for the day.

Seniority (year) multiplier
0 - 1 -> 1
2 - 3 -> 1.1
4 - 5 -> 1.2
> 6   -> 1.7

Overtime (hour) multiplier
0 - 1 -> 2
2 - 3 -> 2.1
> 4   -> 3

For example, Tajuddin has been an employee for Power Motor since 2019 and he has 2.5 hour of overtime
and his hourly rate is RM 20 /per hour.
Number of years = 2

First Hour
(1 * 1.1) * 2 * 20 = 44

Second Hour
(1.5 * 1.1) * 2.1 * 20 = 69.3

Total overtime wages for the day is RM 113.30
Please write a function in any programming language or pseudo-code to determine overtime wages given the
number of years of service and overtime hours.
